Written by �yvind Kol�s pippin@gimp.org in 2013, based around a core of
sensor initialization and reading by by Andres Orencio Ramirez Perez
andy@orencio.org

Rev 2.0
Adapted previous code with new SerLCD Library for using 20x4 displays, with newer functions to control
LCD. Added new Menu's and removed some unused code for clearer comprehension.

In future releases some new sensors will be added in addition to a hardware clock for simplifying all time
functions and readings.

Code adapted by David Cuevas <mr.cavern@gmail.com> with the support and collaboration of Victor Suarez <zerasul@gmail.com>
and Adrian from Artesanos Industriales del Sur.
